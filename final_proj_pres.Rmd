This regression table output demonstrates how Ramadan causes a sigificant decrease in sex and porn related searches in five muslim majority countries. It also indicates how the presence of a feasting holiday, Eid-al-Futr, which occurs in the week following Ramadan, results in an increase in related search values. The regression is run on sex and porn search values aggregated on a weekly basis. 

"Days in Ramadan" is a continuous variable with values zero throuhg seven, designating the number of days in a a given week which include. "Presence of Ramadan" is a binary variable with values of one or zero based on the presence of absence of Ramadan.

"In Eid" is a categorical variable which registers the presence of Eid al-Futr in a given week. Eid al-Futr is a three day feasting holiday which always occurs immediately following Ramadan. Thus, "In Eid" is standing in place for an "after ramadan" variable 

```{r}


```

Reviewing world search values  - we should be shocked to see that indeed the cumulative Global value of sex and porn searches decresaes over Ramadan on a five year basis




It's important to acknowledge that the population covered in my study are those people who access pornography searches not through a proxy site and it is likely that this population would differ somewhat from those who use a proxy site and are not found on google. thus my sample size is not representative of the population as a whole
