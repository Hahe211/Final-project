## <span style="color:red">Ramadan Causes a Decrease in Sex and Porn Related Searches in Five Muslim Majority Countries </span>

  Pornography and Ramadan may seem unrelated. However, these terms are linked in google search values. Online religeous Q & A forums feature many questions from devotees about whether watching pornography material nullifies the act of fasting. Muslims who ordinarily flout the pornography prohibition appear to be cleaning up their act for the Ramadan month and reducing their pornography consumption and engagement with other explicit web based content. 
  
  Examining differences in pornography consumption during Ramadan offers a fruitful metric for gauging soft measures of religious observance. While obviously, many Muslims will continue to consume pornography over the Holiday, flouting the prohibition, others will not. 
  
Ramadan consists of one month in the Islamic lunar calendar lasting about thirty-one days on average, which emphasizes rituals encouraging greater control over physical needs, specifically sex, food and water during the daylight hours. After sunset the fast concludes with prayers at the mosque and then family gathers for a festive breakfast meal, iftar which can last late into the night.

###Findings
 
This study shows a strong negative correlation between the presence of Ramadan and porn searching in majority Muslim countries. The presence of Ramadan in a Muslim country causes a decrease in the frequency of sex and porn related searches. Moreover, there is a ‘rebound effect’ of a 10% increase on Eid al-Futr the celebratory holiday following Ramadan.

#read in data for the first graph which includes indicators for the presence of ramadan/eid and the value for sex and porn searches
#this was compiled in the document final_proj_code rmd  and includes the combined data from the 5 muslim majority countries over the past 5 years on a weekly basis 
#I tried grabbing from a longer time frame but unfortunately in that case the data could only be downloaded on a month level. The right approach for the future would probably be to download twice in 5 year incremements and then bind_cols

select(-keyword, -date1, -date2, -date3, -date4, -date5, -date6) 

graph1 <- graph %>%
  mutate(hits = hits.porn,

  select(hits, category, date, in_ram)

graph2 <- graph %>%
  mutate(hits = hits.sex,

###Data and Multiple Linear Regression 

There are 1305 observations, 1 per week from 2013 to 2018. Data is collected from 5 Muslim majority countries across three continents, namely, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia.

*Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term. *

----------------


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE, results = "asis", cache = TRUE}


#creating display table of summary stats
#using the data frame "graph" which represents the D1_interest data frame from 'final_proj_code1'
#results set to "asis" in order to use html in stargazer

 graph %>% 
  select(-days_in_ram, -days_in_eid, -in_ram,- before2_ram, -in_eid, -days_before, -category, -before_ram, days_before) %>% 
  stargazer(type = "html", title="Summary statistics", digits=1, flip = TRUE, summary.logical= FALSE)
```

-------------------


Controlling for country and year, Ramadan causes a sigificant decrease in sex and porn related searches in five muslim majority countries of around 10 percentages points. As seen in (4) people decrease these searches in the week leading up to Ramadan by about two percentage points. However, in the week following, also known as Eid al-Futr, people significantly increase their searches by around 20 percentage points (seen in 3 and 4). My results are significant p < .01.


-----------------------


*"Days in Ramadan" is a continuous variable with values zero through seven, designating the number of days in a a given week which include Ramadan. "Presence of Ramadan" is a binary variable with values of one or zero based on the presence of absence of Ramadan.*

*"In Eid" is a categorical variable which registers the presence of Eid al-Futr in a given week. Eid al-Futr is a three day feasting holiday which always occurs immediately following Ramadan. Thus, "In Eid" is standing in place for an "after ramadan" variable* 



```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE, results = "asis"}
#regression analysis - putting togethor the regressions
#year and country controls dont make a difference in p values, sd, or coeff so I'm back to removing them -  because data set is already normalized for year and country
ma <- lm(sum ~ days_in_ram, data=graph)
mb <- lm(sum ~ in_ram, data=graph)
m1 <- lm(sum ~ in_ram + in_eid, data=graph)
m3 <- lm(sum ~ before_ram + in_ram + in_eid, data = graph)
#this is the regression of2 weeks before ramadan, I'm commenting out for this first study, but it is noteworthy since it changes the results
#m4 <- lm(sum ~ before2_ram + before_ram + in_ram + in_eid, data = graph)


#use results = asis in the caption to make sure the table prints properly
#final regression code
 stargazer(ma, mb, m1, m3, summary = FALSE, type = "html", title = "Changes in Sex and Porn Related Search Values Over Ramadan", dep.var.labels = "Mean values for 'sex' and 'porn' hits by Week",covariate.labels = c("Days in Ram", "Week Before Ram (0 or 1)", "Presence of Ram (0 or 1)", "Presence of Eid (0 or 1)"))



```

### <span style="color:red">A Global Impact? </span>


Given that Muslims make up about %24 percent of the global population, does the presence of Ramadan may have an impact on worldwide pornography searching?

Exploiting search values aggregated on a global level  - the cumulative global value of sex and porn searches decresaes over Ramadan by one and a half percentage points at the .1 significance level. 

The Muslim population has been projected to increase by about 1.5% a year and by 2060 Muslims will constitute about %32 percent of the global population so their influence on Google trends might increase over time.


-----------------------------

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE, results = "asis", cache = TRUE}
#read in world data
world <- read_rds("world.rds")

w1 <- lm(sum ~ in_ram, data=world)


 stargazer(w1, summary = FALSE, type = "html", title = "Global Level Changes in Sex and Porn Related Search Values Over Ramadan", dep.var.labels = "Mean values for 'sex' and 'porn' hits by Week",covariate.labels = "Presence of Ram (0 or 1)")



```

---------------------

### <span style="color:red">Why the Dip? </span>


Dips in porn consumption over Ramadan may correspond to levels of individual religious observance. However, there could also be social factors of stigma associated with non-observance of Ramadan, which would alter individual practice.


Given that most pornography searches occur at night schedule changes during Ramadan and late family gatherings likely render a significant impact to searching activities.  Additionally, bio-chemical or neurological changes associated with fasting have been [shown](http://www.urologyjournal.org/index.php/uj/article/viewFile/2787/1027) to decrease levels of libido and alter interest in pornographic content. Moreover, many countries have Ramadan laws, which [criminalize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/ramadan_1.shtml) public acts of non-observance.
  

```{r, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Optional hourly code for saudi, commented out
# hourly <- gtrends(c("sex","porn"), gprop = "web", geo = c("SA"), time = "now 7-d") 
# 
#  hourly$interest_over_time %>% 
#   mutate(day = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE), hour = lubridate::hour(date)) %>% 
#     ggplot() +
#   geom_line(aes(x = hour, y = hits, colour = keyword)) +
#   geom_smooth(aes(x = hour, y = hits), se = FALSE) +
#   facet_grid(. ~ day) +

# 

#I redownload the data on an hourly level, hourly data is only availablefrom grends if you download in the last week
#be careful that if I grab the data again then I will have to change the caption because the date will change!
 hourly2 <- gtrends(c("sex","porn"), gprop = "web", geo = c("JO"), time = "now 7-d") 

hourly2$interest_over_time %>% 
  mutate(day = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE), hour = lubridate::hour(date)) %>% 
    ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = hour, y = hits, colour = keyword)) +

###Did I pick the right search terms to capture change in sex and pornography interests over time? Here are some related queries - I'll let you decide. 

####<span style="color:red">Warning: Explicit Content </span>

*Top - The most popular search queries. Scoring is on a relative scale where a value of 100 is the most commonly searched query, 50 is a query searched half as often as the most popular query, and so on*

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE, cache = TRUE}


#justify that I'm picking the right terms (warning explicit content) - since I'm focused with change over time - its not critical that I isolate all the relevant terms but just that they indeed be pornography serach terms  and that they capture a high level of the variation over time
#related queries captures the following: 
# Users searching for your term also searched for these queries. You can sort by the following metrics:

D1 <- gtrends(keyword = c("sex", "porn"), geo = c("EG", "AE","JO", "MA"), time = "today 3-m")

  
D1$related_queries %>% 
     select(subject, value, geo, keyword) %>% 
    datatable(caption = "A Table of Related Queries", rownames = FALSE, colnames = c("Correlation Score", "Related Query", "Country", "Sex/Porn"))



```
