This is a page for regression analysis, tables and charts
in another page, I will look at graphs of - popular hours for porn consumption, changes in porn consumption over time

 
first - try to pull a cross country data frame from google then combine by country... although I could make life easy on myself and not pull more than two countries. 
```{r, cache = TRUE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}

#create preliminary data set from gtrends - last 5 years. Although I would have ideally liked to gather data from more than 5 years - I'm limited in scope because the algorithm can't pull more data then that at a time




  #download data for sex and porn searches, this has to be done seperately or there's an overload issue
D1 <- gtrends(keyword = c("sex"), geo = c("EG", "SA", "AE","JO", "MA"), time = "today+5-y")
D2 <- gtrends(keyword = c("porn"), geo = c("EG", "SA", "AE","JO", "MA"), time = "today+5-y") 
 

  #combine data for sex and porn searches by merging D2 and D1
#search values are stored in the interest over time tibble: here is some information from google on what that represents:
# Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.

D2_interest <- D2$interest_over_time %>% 
  select(hits, date, geo) %>% 
  transmute(hits.porn = hits, date = date, geo = geo)
  

D1_interest <- D1$interest_over_time %>% 
  rename(hits.sex = hits) %>% 
  left_join(D2_interest, by = c("date", "geo")) %>% 
  mutate(sum = (hits.sex + hits.porn)/2)

#download world data to see if theres a world influence, the default is world data unless you change something
world <- gtrends(keyword = "sex", time = "today+5-y")
world2 <- gtrends(keyword = "porn", time = "today+5-y")

world2 <- world2$interest_over_time %>% 
  select(hits, date, geo) %>% 
  transmute(hits_porn = hits, date = date, geo = geo)

world_interest <- world$interest_over_time %>% 
  rename(hits_sex = hits) %>% 
  left_join(world2, by = c("date", "geo")) %>% 
  mutate(sum = (hits_sex + hits_porn)/2)

#load the data set I made with dates of ramadan and major holidays

ramadan_dates <- read_excel("ramadan_dates.xlsx")


```


The table below shows related queries for searches in the category of sex and porn over Ramadan. Two demonstrate the nature of the searches I display the top 10 related search values. Warning, this includes graphic content.
According to the google trends website, scoring is on a relative scale where a value of 100 is the most commonly searched query, 50 is a query searched half as often as the most popular query, and so on.
  
```{r, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#showing/determining high volume porn searches 


#justify that I'm picking the right terms (warning explicit content) - since I'm focused with change over time - its not critical that I isolate all the relevant terms but just that they indeed be pornography serach terms  and that they capture a high level of the variation over time
#related queries captures the following: 
# Users searching for your term also searched for these queries. You can sort by the following metrics:
# * Top - The most popular search queries. Scoring is on a relative scale where a value of 100 is the most commonly searched query, 50 is a query searched half as often as the most popular query, and so on.

This table of descriptive statistics gives an overview of the data. As indicated, there are 1305 observations, 1 per week. Understanding values for sex and porn searches:
According to the google trends website, numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.

This regression table output demonstrates how Ramadan causes a sigificant decrease in sex and porn related searches in five muslim majority countries. It also indicates how the presence of a feasting holiday, Eid-al-Futr, which occurs in the week following Ramadan, results in an increase in related search values. The regression is run on sex and porn search values aggregated on a weekly basis. 

"Days in Ramadan" is a continuous variable with values zero throuhg seven, designating the number of days in a a given week which include. "Presence of Ramadan" is a binary variable with values of one or zero based on the presence of absence of Ramadan.

"Days in Eid" is a continuous variable which registers the presence of Eid al-Futr in a given week. Eid al-Futr is a three day feasting holiday which occurs immediately following Ramadan. 
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE, results = "asis"}
#use results = asis in the caption to make sure the table prints properly
#final regression code
regress1 <- stargazer(ma, mb, m1, m2, m3, m4, summary = FALSE, type = "html", title = "Changes in Sex and Porn Related Search Values Over Ramadan in 5 Muslim-Majority Countries", dep.var.labels = "Mean values for 'sex' and 'porn' hits by Week",  covariate.labels = c("Days in Ram", "Presence of Ram (0 or 1)", "Presence of Eid (0 or 1)"))




```
Reviewing world search values  - we should be shocked to see that indeed the cumulative Global value of sex and porn searches decresaes over Ramadan on a five year basis
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE, results = "asis"}

# stargazer(w1, w2, w3, w4, summary = FALSE, type = "html", title = "Changes in Sex and Porn Related Search Values Over Ramadan on a Global Scale", dep.var.labels = "Global Values for 'sex' and 'porn' hits by Week",  covariate.labels = c("Days in Ram", "Presence of Ram (0 or 1)", "Days in Eid"))
# 


```








It's important to acknowledge that the population covered in my study are those people who access pornography searches not through a proxy site and it is likely that this population would differ somewhat from those who use a proxy site and are not found on google. thus my sample size is not representative of the population as a whole
