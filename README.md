# Final-project


Structure of my project is as follows:

1. Aggregate Graph of Pornography consumption over time in the 9 countries under my study, displaying dips over Ramadan 
(either control for yera in the graph or download the data by yera and then combine multiple years togethor)



2. Regression analysis on how the presence of ramadan impacts change in pornography consumption over time in Ramadan 


3. 
Comparative analysis on other countries during their holidays? 


4. global analysis - there's a slight worldwide dip in porn consumption over ramdadan!
