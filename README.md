# What is the Impact of Ramadan on "Porn" and "Sex" Related Searches on Google? 


This project finds a 9 percentage point decrease in searches for porn and sex related content over the past five years during Ramadan in the countries of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Jordan. Likewise, there is a  15 percentage point increase in such searches in the week following Ramadan which has the feasting holiday, Eid al-Futr. 

When I consider the week before Ramadan, individuals start to limit their consumption in advance, with a decrease of about five percentage point. 

This project also examines the global impact of Ramadan and similarly finds a -1.5 percentage point decrease, probably due to the large global muslim population. 


I aggregate data using the gtrends google search library in R.
