# What is the Impact of Ramadan on "Porn" and "Sex" Related Searches on Google? 


This project finds a significant decrease in pornography consumption over the past five years during Ramadan in the countries of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Jordan.

This project also examines the global impact of Ramadan and similarly finds a negative relationship between Ramadan and pornography searching, probably due to the large global muslim population. 

I aggregate data using the gtrends google search library in R.
